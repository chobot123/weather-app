# weather-app

I created a simple weather app by fetching the API weather data from 'openweathermap.org'

This app...:
  1) Asks for user input of a city
  2) displays said city's name
  3) displays today's date in local time (en-US)
  4) displays how it feels like, humidity, temperature, wind, etc...
